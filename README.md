# How to run #

Dependencies:
* `Docker` and `docker-compose` are needed for running the app. Here are the instructions:
* docker. See [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
* docker-compose. See [docs.docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you're done, simply `cd` to your project and run `docker-compose up -build`. This will initialise and start all the
containers, then leave them running in the background.
